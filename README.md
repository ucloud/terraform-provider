Requirements
------------

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.11.x
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.11 (to build the provider plugin)

Building The Provider
---------------------

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-ucloud`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers
$ git clone git@github.com:terraform-providers/terraform-provider-ucloud
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-ucloud
$ make build
```

Using the provider
----------------------

If you're building the provider, follow the instructions to [install it as a plugin.](https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/basics.html#installing-a-plugin) After placing it into your plugins directory,  run `terraform init` to initialize it.

Developing the Provider
---------------------------

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.11+ is *required*). You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ make build
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-ucloud
...
```

In order to test the provider, you can simply run `make test`.

```sh
$ make test
```

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```sh
$ make testacc
```

## Acceptance Testing

Before making a release, the resources and data sources are tested automatically with acceptance tests (the tests are located in the `ucloud/*_test.go` files).

You can run them by entering the following instructions in a terminal:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-ucloud
export UCLOUD_PUBLIC_KEY=xxx
export UCLOUD_PRIVATE_KEY=xxx
export UCLOUD_REGION=xxx
export UCLOUD_PROJECT_ID=xxx
TF_ACC=1 TF_LOG=INFO go test ./ucloud -v -run="^TestAccUCloud" -timeout=1440m
```
